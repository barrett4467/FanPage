    <h2>About the Band</h2>

    <p>
      Fleetwood Mac is a well-known British-American rock band. The band was founded in 1998 by guitarist Peter Green, drummer Mick Fleetwood, 
      and guitarist Jeremy Spencer. They were later joined by bassist John Mcvile, guitarist Danny Kirwan and keyboardist Christine Perfect. 
      In the beginning, Fleetwood Mac was primarily a British blues band. They earned a UK number one with

    <p> In early 1970, all three of the original guitarists had left the band. They were eventually replaced by guitarists Bob Welch and 
            Bob Wetson as well as vocalist Dave Walker. By 1974, all three had left the band, leaving Fleetwood Mac without a male lead guitarist or 
            vocalist. In late 1974, Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham joined.  With the addition of Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham, the band's sound
            changed to more of a pop-rock vibe. Fleetwood Mac would go on to achieve number 1 in the US for their album "Fleetwood Mac" 
    </p>

    <p>The rest, as they say is history. Fleetwood Mac went on to earn number one on American album charts for 31 consecutive weeks with their second album
          "Rumours". There's been several changes with the original band, largely due to personal turmoil between members, but Fleetwood Mac is still releasing albums.
